# Installation

## If using OSX

I'm using the emacs-mac option in most cases following the instructions here:  [https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport](https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport)

After this port is added be sure to include module support.  It looks like its there by default, but vterm gave me some issues without adding it in specifically.  I also like the modern icon.

```text
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
brew install emacs-mac --with-modules --with-modern-icon
```

## Configuration
